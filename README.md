# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe game written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Key Takeaways

Very rewarding project in terms of practice writing JS. The main goal was to have everything tucked away into it's own factory function/IIFE and avoid poluting the global scope.

This was a real eye opener in terms of thinking about how to structure my code and assigning each function a particular goal. It was also important to separate the major constructors/factories like the UI controller, the gameflow function and the player factory function and have them only encapsulate methods that relate to their purpose.

Coding the AI was also super insightful and I dipped my toes in recursive functions but I still have a ways to go on that front.

Great project overall and very happy with the final result.
